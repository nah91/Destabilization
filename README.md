# Destabilization

Orbit Destabilization
///Start with 3 body orbit including star(sun)

///Follow with impact on earth to destabilize orbit

///Trials of varying sized "Meteors"

///Moon formation theory?

///Sun-Jupiter-Earth System:
Could go further and add in other planets in semi-realistic orbital positions and velocities in order to complicate system and observe if they significantly alter the effect of the Earth's new orbit relative to simple Sun-Earth system (especially Jupiter).

///Challenges:
1. How to organize data. ie; Should we save the constants in a file and read them rather than declare them at the beginning? (may be easier to read)
2. How to write odeint function with n objects in a more streamlined manner?
3.
