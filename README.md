# Destabilization

Orbit Destabilization

///Start with 3 body orbit (earth, moon, sun)
We would start with a three body orbit consisting of the earth, the sun, and the moon.  This is simple enough by considering the sun a stationary object, a rotating object about the stationary (the earth), and a co-rotating object about the rotating object (the moon).

///Follow with impact on earth to destabilize orbit
We would then replace the moon with another celestial body that would impact the earth and destabilize its orbit around the sun.

///Trials of varying sized Meteors
Using different sizes and speeds for the meteors that would either change or fully destabilize the orbit of the earth.  This can be done in the form of tests.  The collisions would have to be considered elastic for simplicity sake.  Could consider elastic because they are in space which is is essentially a vacuum.  

///How would the destabilizing of the Earth's orbit around the sun affect the moon's orbit over time?
