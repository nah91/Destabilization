# Destabilization

Orbit Destabilization

///Start with 3 body orbit (earth, moon, sun) We would start with a three body orbit consisting of the earth, the sun, and the moon. This is simple enough by considering the sun a stationary object, a rotating object about the stationary (the earth), and a co-rotating object about the rotating object (the moon).

///Follow with impact on earth to destabilize orbit We would then replace the moon with another celestial body that would impact the earth and destabilize its orbit around the sun.

///Trials of varying sized Meteors Using different sizes and speeds for the meteors that would either change or fully destabilize the orbit of the earth. This can be done in the form of tests. The collisions would have to be considered elastic for simplicity sake. Could consider elastic because they are in space which is is essentially a vacuum.

///How would the destabilizing of the Earth's orbit around the sun affect the moon's orbit over time?

///Moon formation theory?

///Sun-Jupiter-Earth System:
Could go further and add in other planets in semi-realistic orbital positions and velocities in order to complicate system and observe if they significantly alter the effect of the Earth's new orbit relative to simple Sun-Earth system (especially Jupiter).

///Challenges:
1. How to organize data. ie; Should we save the constants in a file and read them rather than declare them at the beginning? (may be easier to read)
2. How to write odeint function with n objects in a more streamlined manner?
3. Test cases for collisions

///Short Term Goals
Simulate the solar system
build 3-body system for collisions and test collisions in said system
